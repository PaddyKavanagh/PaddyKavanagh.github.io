    "## Purpose and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In virtually all types of physical experiments, measurements are made and numbers are recorded, i.e. data is gathered. Frequently this data gathering process is automated by interfacing computers to a wide variety of transducers. We are concerned in this series of lectures with what should be done to the data once it is gathered. There are no simple, general prescriptions to data analysis - the type of analysis to be done will depend on the type of data measured, and the information required from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of standard procedures which are frequently used to characterize, or “reduce” often vast datasets to a few pertinent numbers. For example, the number of occasions in the Third Year Laboratory that you had to find the slope and its error of a best fit line to a series of experimental points (Hall Effect, Thermistor, Bangor Cp/Cv, Planck’s Constant, Fabry Perot, Light-to-Frequency Transducer, etc.). Least-squares fitting is one of the data analysis techniques that shall be discussed in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn about data analysis is to analyze data. The general approach which will be applied to each topic we discuss will be as follows: \n",
    "* We shall, as briefly as possible, deal with the theory behind the analysis method, in many cases without full derivation\n",
    "* Then, implement the method in a Python program and test the program by applying it to some data.\n",
    "* In each case, the data will be simulated by using another Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real data is subject to random errors. No matter how well you perform experimental measurements, the resulting data will exhibit some degree of scatter about the best-fit line. (There may also be systematic errors, due for example to an incorrectly calibrated equipment, we will not address systematic errors here.) For our simulated datasets to be realistic, we deliberately “add noise” to the simulated measurements so that they show the characteristic “scatter” of real data. To do this, we first address the issue of **random numbers**, which will be the topic of the next lecture."
