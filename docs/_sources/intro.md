Welcome to my homepage.

I am a lecturer in the Department of Physics at Maynooth University. My research is focused on the matter cycle in galaxies through multi-wavelength observations of young stellar objects and star formation, star-forming regions, supernova remnants, superbubbles, and the interstellar medium. In past I worked on calibration and software development of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I currently lead a Research Ireland Pathway funded group.

On side bar on the right you will find information on some of my modules at Maynooth University, as well as other useful tools I have developed over the years.
